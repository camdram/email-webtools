The Postal mail queue length alert is firing!

Summary:

The queue of mail waiting to be delivered by Postal is exceeding normal
operational levels. This could be due to server issues (eg. the message
broker or SMTP daemon has crashed) or simply because Camdram is sending
a very high rate of email within a very short timeframe (eg. spam).

Remedial action to take:

1. Login to the admin interface at https://mail.camdram.net and monitor
   the situation.
2. Ensure both MariaDB and RabbitMQ are functioning using 'sudo
   systemctl status mariadb rabbitmq-server'.
3. Run the following to check the status of the email system 'cd
   /home/postal/app && sudo -Hu postal procodile status'.
4. If necessary, restart the email system by typing 'sudo systemctl
   restart postal'.

If everything is functioning normally, Postal should automatically pick
up mail from the queue and process it appropriately. In the event that a
large burst of mail is sent within a short timeframe then it is possible
that the outgoing rate limit will be exceeded and further messages will
be held back instead of being sent. You will be notified in a separate
alert if this occurs.
