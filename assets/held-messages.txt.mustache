The held mail alert is firing!

Summary:

The number of messages being held back by Postal is non-zero. This is 
likely due to Camdram exceeding the outgoing rate limit by sending a 
very large burst of mail within a short timeframe.

The number of held messages is {{HeldMessages}}.

Remedial action to take:

1. Login to the web interface at https://mail.camdram.net/ and monitor 
   the situation using the online admin tools.
2. If the number of held messages is small and the rate limit has not 
   been exceeded then you may manually release messages using the online 
   admin tools.
3. If the number of held messages is large then manually releasing each 
   is likely to be laborious. Open a Postal console using the following 
   shell command and type in the Ruby code shown below (this will sleep 
   for one hour before attempting to resend the first 140 messages in 
   the queue):
   `sudo postal console`

=======================================================================
server = Server.find_by(uuid: "b119aaeb-64e3-47b1-a991-c7297371a573")
db = server.message_db
begin
  sleep 3600
  messages = db.messages(where: {held: 1, scope: 'outgoing'}, limit: 320)
  puts "Sending #{messages.length} message at #{Time.now}"
  messages.each do |msg|
    msg.add_to_message_queue(manual: true)
  end
end until messages.length == 0
=======================================================================

This alert may be accompanied by a separate alert regarding the length 
of the Postal mail queue. This usually indicates that a large burst of 
mail has been sent at the same time, or within the space of a few 
minutes, rather than a steady steam over the course of an hour.
