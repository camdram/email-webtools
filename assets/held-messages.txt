The held mail queue alert is firing!

Summary:

The number of messages being held back by Postal is non-zero. This
is likely due to Camdram exceeding the outgoing rate limit by sending a
very large burst of mail within a short timeframe.

Remedial action to take:

1. Login to the admin interface at https://mail.camdram.net and monitor
   the situation.
2. If the number of held messages is small and the rate limit has not
   been exceeded then you may manually release messages using the
   Postal user interface.
3. If the number of held messages is large then manually releasing each
   is likely to be laborious. Open a Postal console using the following
   command 'cd /home/postal/app && sudo -Hu postal bin/postal console'
   and type the following Ruby code inside (this will sleep for one
   hour before attempting to resend the first 140 messages in the
   queue):

=======================================================================
org = Organization.first
server = org.servers.first
db = server.message_db
begin
  sleep 3600
  messages = db.messages(where: {held: 1}, limit: 140)
  messages.each do |msg|
    msg.add_to_message_queue(manual: true)
  end
end until messages.length == 0
=======================================================================

This alert may be accompanied by a separate alert regarding the length
of the Postal mail queue. This usually indicates that a large burst of
mail has been sent at the same time, or within the space of a few
minutes.
