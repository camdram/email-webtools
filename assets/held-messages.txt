The length of the Camdram held mail queue is alerting!

Summary:

The number of messages being held back by Postal is non-zero. This
could be due to server issues (eg. the message broker or SMTP daemon
has crashed) or simply because Camdram is sending a very high rate of
email (eg. spam).

Remedial action to take:

1. Login to the admin interface at https://mail.camdram.net and monitor
   the situation.
2. Ensure both MariaDB and RabbitMQ are functioning using 'sudo
   systemctl status mariadb rabbitmq-server'.
3. Run the following to check the status of the email system 'cd
   /home/postal/app && sudo -Hu postal procodile status'.
4. If necessary, restart the email system by typing 'sudo systemctl
   restart postal'.
5. If the queue is not going down then open a Postal console using
   the following command 'cd /home/postal/app && sudo -Hu postal
   bin/postal console' and type the following Ruby code inside:

=======================================================================
org = Organization.first
server = org.servers.first
db = server.message_db
begin
  sleep 3600
  messages = db.messages(where: {held: 1}, limit: 140)
  messages.each do |msg|
    msg.add_to_message_queue(manual: true)
  end
end until messages.length == 0
=======================================================================

   This will sleep for one hour before attempting to resend the first
   140 messages in the queue.
